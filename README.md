This project focuses on analyzing an e-commerce store's data to gain insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. By leveraging SQL for data extraction and manipulation, and Python for advanced data analysis and visualization, this project aims to uncover actionable insights that can drive strategic business decisions.

Objectives:
Data Extraction and Cleaning:

Utilize SQL to extract relevant data from the e-commerce database.
Perform data cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency in the dataset.
Sales Performance Analysis:

Analyze sales data to identify trends, peak sales periods, and top-selling products.
Calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, average order value, and customer lifetime value.
Customer Behavior Analysis:

Segment customers based on purchasing behavior and demographics.
Identify patterns in customer retention and churn rates.
Analyze customer feedback and reviews to gauge satisfaction levels.

Product Analysis:

Assess product performance by analyzing sales volume, return rates, and customer ratings.
Identify best-selling and underperforming products.
Analyze the impact of promotions and discounts on product sales.

Visualization and Reporting:

Use Python libraries (such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) to create insightful visualizations.
Develop dashboards and reports to present findings to stakeholders.

Tools and Technologies:
SQL:
Data extraction and manipulation using SQL queries.
Database management and optimization.

Python:
Data analysis using pandas for data manipulation.
Data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn.
Statistical analysis and modeling with libraries such as NumPy and SciPy.

Methodology:
